In the past the students conducted the practical at one of the university labs. The purpose of building the website was to allow the students to conduct the experiments on the same equipment at the lab by using the web interface. Therefore, reducing any consequences of the Covid measures put on by the government on the study experience for the students.</p>\n      <div className=\"responsive\">\n      <img src=\"/images/projects/front.png\" alt=\"Front page\" class=\"responsive\"/>\n      </div>\n      <p>The design goal was made to use a database to store all the information that the students submit at each section of the practical. The backend of the website was therefore written in Django with a database running on a MySQL server. The front-end of the website used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2. </p>\n      <img src=\"/images/projects/data.png\" alt=\"Front page\" class=\"responsive\"/>\n      <p>The purpose of the website was to be fucntional and fufill the requirments set by the professor of the course.
